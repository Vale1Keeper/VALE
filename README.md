Vale (VLE) – A Digital Store of Value
Vale is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a fixed supply of 33.3 million coins, designed as a long-term store of value. It operates on a secure, open-source blockchain that uses a hybrid Proof of Time & Work (PoTW) consensus mechanism, enabling 2-second block times and sub-5-second finality while remaining energy-efficient and ASIC-resistant. The total supply is issued over a 100-year period, with halvings occurring every four years, and 3.3 million VLE allocated to the founder, released linearly over ten years to ensure long-term network support. Built with post-quantum cryptography from launch—using CRYSTALS-Dilithium and SPHINCS+—Vale is designed to remain secure in future computing environments. It runs on consumer-grade hardware, supports global node participation, and emphasizes decentralization, simplicity, and sustainability. The protocol is unlicensed, uncensored, and maintained by its users. Code and documentation are publicly available at github.com/vale-core/vale.
